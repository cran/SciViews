### Bugs in winMenuXXX:
# 1) Error while changing action of a menu
# 2) Defining the underline works, but the corresponding shortcut does not
# 3) GPF when trying to allocate items to '$Graph1Main'
# 4) 'Testit' & $ConsoleMain/Testit' is treated as different things!

### TODO
# 1) Allow different languages for menus and tools (ex: Menus-fr.txt) and use
     them automatically.
# 2) Allow different styles for images depending on platform and style, and use
     them automatically.
# 3) Make a guiReadPackage() that reads images, icons, menus, toolbars & windows
     in row!
# 4) Context and contextual windows, menus, tools, ...
# 5) In the list of windows, include also RGui windows (console, graphs, etc...)
# 6) Allow creation of a Tk menu, even if the corresponding Tk window is not open!
